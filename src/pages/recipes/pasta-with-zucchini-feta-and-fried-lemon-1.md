Step 1

Cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain

and rinse pasta with cool water to stop cooking and toss with a drizzle

of olive oil to prevent sticking; set aside.

Step 2

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add

walnuts, if using, and toss to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until

walnuts are toasted and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted

spoon or strainer, transfer the walnuts to a small bowl (leaving the oil

behind) and season with salt; set aside.

Step 3

Add shallots and lemon to the oil and season with salt and pepper.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until both the shallots and lemons are

totally softened and have begun to caramelize, 5 to 8 minutes. Add

capers and stir to coat in the oil, letting them sizzle a minute or two.

Step 4

Add zucchini and season with salt and pepper. (Do not be alarmed at

the amount of zucchini in the skillet; it will cook down by about half.)

Cook, stirring occasionally, until much of the water has evaporated

from the zucchini and it has totally softened, become translucent and

is beginning to brown at the edges, 10 to 15 minutes. (This mixture

should be very flavorful and lightly saucy.)

Step 5

Remove pan from heat and add pasta, tossing to coat. (If your skillet is

very full, you can always transfer everything to a large bowl and toss to

coat there.) Season with salt and pepper.

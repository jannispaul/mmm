1. Set a small strainer over a heatproof bowl. Heat about 1⁄2 inch of olive or canola oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the sliced prosciutto and sage leaves and fry just until crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain in the strainer then spread out on a paper towel. Set aside., 2 Bring broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer., 3 Heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in a large high-sided skillet or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the chopped prosciutto and shallot; cook, stirring, until the shallot is just beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the minced sage, rice and 1 cup pears; stir to coat with the oil. Add wine and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring, until the wine is almost absorbed by the rice, 1 to 3 minutes., 4 Add enough of the hot broth to just cover the rice mixture. Adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook, stirring constantly, until almost all the broth is absorbed., Continue to add the hot broth, about 1⁄2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition until all the liquid has been absorbed and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer, until the rice begins to get creamy, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 cup pears., 5 Continue to add broth, about 1⁄2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition until all the liquid has been absorbed and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer, until the rice is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes more. (You may not need all of the simmering broth.) Remove from the heat and let stand for 1 minute. Stir in cheese and butter. Season with pepper., 6 Serve the risotto garnished with the fried sage leaves, fried prosciutto and additional cheese, if desired.
